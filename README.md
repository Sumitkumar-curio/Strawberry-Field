# Quantum Circuits with Strawberry Fields

This repository contains two quantum circuits implemented using [Strawberry Fields](https://strawberryfields.ai/), Xanadu's open-source Python library for continuous-variable quantum computation.

## 1. Boson Sampling

Boson Sampling is a computational problem that uses Fock states and beam splitter arrays to simulate a specific class of quantum systems. The `boson_sampling.py` script sets up and runs a 4-mode boson sampling experiment using the Fock basis.

### Code:
- `boson_sampling.py`: The script simulates a boson sampling circuit using rotation and beam splitter gates.

## 2. Quantum Gate Teleportation

Quantum teleportation is a process by which a qumode's quantum state is transferred to another mode via a shared entangled state. The `gate_teleportation.py` script demonstrates quantum teleportation using Gaussian states.

### Code:
- `gate_teleportation.py`: Implements a teleportation protocol using two-mode squeezed states and homodyne measurement.
